Tape Archive


you call the tar file as `tarball` too.


## Historical Reason

The old times when they had to use tape to back up, the tape did not have random access, so they had to write all the files in a single stream. Thus, they created the `tar` command to archive multiple files into a single file.

[[tar]] simply stores files and their metadata into a single file without compression.
