## Goal

To really achieve my goals, I need to keep my sleep in check.

## Performance

> [!TIP]
> Note that I do not track go-to-bed time officially, and is optional.

You can see the proofs for sleep times here: [./proofs/sleep/](./proofs/sleep/)

Here is my performance, with expected wake up time of `4:30 AM`:

|    Date     | Average |                      Wake                      |
|:-----------:|:-------:|:----------------------------------------------:|
|  12/28~1/3  |   ...   |             6:28, 22:45~4:30, ...              |
| 12/21~12/27 |  5:03   | 5:46, 4:12, 4:28, 4:18, 22:14~4:29, 7:09, 4:28 |
