## Goal

To really sleep well, I need to stop watching electronics on bed.

## Performance

`NO` for no electronics on bed, `-` for no data, `Yes...` for electronics used on bed

- `NO`: no electronics on bed; good
- `OKAY`: used electronics a bit on bed; but did not completely lie down with it
- `YES`: used electronics on bed; very bad
