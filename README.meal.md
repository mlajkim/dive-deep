## Goal

> [!CAUTION]
> **Don't fall for the Perfectionism Trap:**
> - **The Real Goal**: Tracking is about recognizing patterns, not creating a perfect database. Even rough or partial entries are GREAT enough to maintain awareness and control.
> - **The Instinct's Lie**: Your survival instinct fights against dietary restriction. It tries to trick you by whispering, "If you can't track it perfectly, it's meaningless." This is a lie designed to lead you back to mindless eating.
> - **The Strategy**: Controlling your diet is a battle against biology. Never forget that a flawed record is infinitely better than zero record. Do not let "perfection" become your excuse to give up.

To not fall into food comma, stay sharp and well fit, I need to maintain my daily intake.

## Performance

> [!TIP]
> Grocery activities give you more chances to buy healthier food over delivery or eating out.
