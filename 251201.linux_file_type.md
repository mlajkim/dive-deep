# Dive in

## List of file types in Linux

Setup:
```sh
test_name=test
tmp_dir=$(date +%y%m%d_%H%M%S_$test_name)
mkdir -p ~/test_dive/$tmp_date && cd ~/test_dive/$tmp_dir
```

> [!NOTE]
> Following commands might need `sudo` permission to run

create each file type available in Linux:
```sh
sudo mknod block_device b 7 0
sudo mknod char_device c 1 5
mkfifo pipe_named
echo "This is a regular file." > regular_file.txt
mkdir directory
ln -s regular_file.txt symbolic_link
python3 -c "import socket; s=socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX); s.bind('unix_socket')"
```
