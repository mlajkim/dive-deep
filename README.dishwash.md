## Goal

We may look down on dishwash duty, but it is an important part of household chores. The goal of this document is to track my dishwash duty performance.

## Eventually

I want to stop doing this record by buying a dishwasher machine in the future, but until then, I will keep tracking my dishwash duty.

## Performance
  
Basically want to do dishwash every day, with max of 15 minutes:
