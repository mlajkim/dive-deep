## Goal

The current goal, officially starting on Dec 21, 2025~, is to:

- 1 Golf / a week (Including both Golf Course AND Golf Range)
- 3 Workouts / a week
- 1 Cardio

## Performance

> [!WARNING]
> You can only add dates only when you have proofs stored under `/workout/*`
> Proofs can be:
> - Gym Entry Records
> - Apple Watch Screenshots
> - Golf Range Records / Score Cards
> - Anything that anyone can verify later

> [!TIP]
> It is allowed to write A WEEK ahead of time, but not more than that. This is to ensure that you are motivated to do more or workout in advance to handle certain schedules upcoming.
