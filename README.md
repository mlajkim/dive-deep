# Glossary

## Zero-brain run

A "zero-brain run" is an approach where you run a command or piece of code without fully understanding it, to see what happens. This method helps in learning through exploration and experimentation, allowing you to observe the behavior of the code and gain insights that can lead to a deeper understanding over time.


## Rules

### How to write date

Write date:

- `...<date>` means that I want to finish it by that date
- `...<date> 90%` means that I have finished 90% of it by that date
- `<date>` means that I have finished it on that date
