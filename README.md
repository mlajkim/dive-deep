# Goal

The general goal of **diving deep** is to really understand what’s happening *inside*, rather than only partially understanding the surface. Sometimes, for speed, it’s important to learn only the surface, but great decisions come from the **knowledge gained underneath**. And since humans tend not to dive deep because it can feel like too much work, we need to purposefully remind ourselves to dive into it with clear goals.

## Dive Deep & Become Golden Kubestronaut

I want to become a **Golden Kubestronaut**. But while doing that, I also want to *dive deep* whenever I learn something new — for example, checking the source code of the Linux `cd` command rather than just learning that `cd` means "change directory".

# Glossary

## Zero-brain run

A "zero-brain run" is an approach where you run a command or piece of code without fully understanding it, to see what happens. This method helps in learning through exploration and experimentation, allowing you to observe the behavior of the code and gain insights that can lead to a deeper understanding over time.
