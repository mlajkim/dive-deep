## Oauth

We did have password technology, but also at the sametime we want to give certain permission to certain application to access our data. 

- `O`: Open
- `Auth`: Authorization

Please note that it is NOT `Authentication`, so it is more focused in `Authorization`.

Imagine you have a car, and you want to give your friend permission to drive your car. You don't want to give him your car key/or the trunk key, but you want to give him permission to drive your car. So you give him a valet key, which only allows him to drive your car.

So here is how it works:

1. 3rd party service asks to read the list of contracts in a service
1. Your service then asks you to login to the service
1. Your service will ask if you want him to allow the 3rd party service to access your contracts
1. Your service will then pass the `token` to the 3rd party service
