As I started writing my first tech blog, I wanted to:

- Use my github repository as a SSOT for the documentation & sample images
- Automate the deployment of my docs to the platform
- The platform has likes & comments features (so that I do not have to build my own)
- That platform has some good user pools (Not necessary to be the biggest, but why not)

So I decided to use [dev.to](https://dev.to/) as my blogging platform. It has all the features I wanted, and it is free to use, and pushing the my docs to the platform is as simple as pushing markdown files to my github repository.

However, I found a problem. I have a huge gif file that I wanted to include in my blog post, but dev.to has a file size limit of 10MB for images. I do not want to think about how big/small my gif files should be, and I want to focus on writing the content. So I wanted to find some other platforms that can host my images without worrying about the file size limit.
