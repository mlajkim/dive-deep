# Dive in

## General definition of inode
inode, short for `index node`, is a fundamental concept in Unix-like file systems that serves as a data structure to store information about files and directories. Each `file` *or* `directory` on the file system is represented by an inode, which contains metadata about the file but *NOT* its name or actual data content.

## Benefits of separating file name (location) and inode

Users can modify its file name or move it to a different directory without changing the underlying inode.

Setup:
```sh
tmp_date=$(date +%y%m%d_%H%M%S_test)
mkdir -p ~/test_dive/$tmp_date && cd ~/test_dive/$tmp_date

echo 'Hello Inode!' > sample_file.txt
stat sample_file.txt
```
