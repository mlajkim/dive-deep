# Dive in

## General definition of inode
inode, short for `index node`, is a fundamental concept in Unix-like file systems that serves as a data structure to store information about files and directories. Each `file` *or* `directory` on the file system is represented by an inode, which contains metadata about the file but *NOT* its name or actual data content.

## Benefits of separating file name (location) and inode

Users can modify its file name or move it to a different directory without changing the underlying inode.

## What's inside the inode

Setup:
```sh
tmp_date=$(date +%y%m%d_%H%M%S_test)
mkdir -p ~/test_dive/$tmp_date && cd ~/test_dive/$tmp_date

echo 'Hello Inode!' > sample_file.txt
mkdir sample_dir
```

Test:
```sh
stat -x sample_file.txt
#   File: "sample_file.txt"
#   Size: 13           FileType: Regular File
#   Mode: (0644/-rw-r--r--)         Uid: (  501/     ajk)  Gid: (   20/   staff)
# Device: 1,17   Inode: 110676931    Links: 1
# Access: Sun Nov 30 13:47:49 2025
# Modify: Sun Nov 30 13:47:48 2025
# Change: Sun Nov 30 13:47:48 2025
#  Birth: Sun Nov 30 13:47:48 2025
```

Test:
```sh
stat -x sample_dir
#   File: "sample_dir"
#   Size: 64           FileType: Directory
#   Mode: (0755/drwxr-xr-x)         Uid: (  501/     ajk)  Gid: (   20/   staff)
# Device: 1,17   Inode: 110678458    Links: 2
# Access: Sun Nov 30 13:55:40 2025
# Modify: Sun Nov 30 13:55:40 2025
# Change: Sun Nov 30 13:55:40 2025
#  Birth: Sun Nov 30 13:55:40 2025
```

### You can also which file contains that specific inode

Please fine a file with inode number `110676931`
```sh
find . -inum 110676931
# ./sample_file.txt
```
