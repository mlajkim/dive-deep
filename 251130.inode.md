## General definition of inode
inode, short for `index node`, is a fundamental concept in Unix-like file systems that serves as a data structure to store information about files and directories. Each `file` *or* `directory` on the file system is represented by an inode, which contains metadata about the file but *NOT* its name or actual data content.
