## Fastest / Most motivated way to learn

To let your brain know that you are progressing, it is recommended to:

1. Finish watch one video lesson with minimum note-taking
2. Do hands on after
3. Place the following tag in your note file to track your progress

```md
---
tags:
- hands-on-tested
---
```

### Rationale: Human wants progress

If you are stuck in one place for too long, your brain will lose motivation to continue learning. By finishing one video lesson and doing hands-on right after, you can let your brain know that you are making progress, which will motivate you to continue learning.

### Rationale: Context Switching

If you do video => hands-on => video => hands-on, your brain will have to context switch too often, even when it seems like they are of course related. By finishing one video lesson and doing hands-on right after, you can minimize context switching and maximize focus.
