## Fastest / Most motivated way to learn

To let your brain know that you are progressing, it is recommended to:

1. Finish watch one video lesson with minimum note-taking
2. Do hands on after
3. Place the following tag in your note file to track your progress

```md
---
tags:
- hands-on-tested
---
```

### Rationale: Human wants progress

If you are stuck in one place for too long, your brain will lose motivation to continue learning. By finishing one video lesson and doing hands-on right after, you can let your brain know that you are making progress, which will motivate you to continue learning.

### Rationale: Context Switching

If you do video => hands-on => video => hands-on, your brain will have to context switch too often, even when it seems like they are of course related. By finishing one video lesson and doing hands-on right after, you can minimize context switching and maximize focus.

### Rationale: Mode Changing

You can have two different modes:

- Note taking mode
- Understanding mode

Now when you watch a video, if you too focus on note taking, you will lose understanding. By finishing one video lesson with minimum note-taking, you can maximize understanding.

Then when you do hands-on, you can switch to note taking mode and summarize notes on what you have learned and practiced.

Also you can always go back to your video & AI later if you need more understanding! EASY!

### Rationale: Progress Feeling For Tag

After the hands-on is done, placing the tag `hands-on-tested` in your note file will give you a sense of accomplishment and progress, because you know that:

- You have finished a video, which is a step forward in your learning journey
- You have done hands-on, which is a practical application of what you have learned

### Rationale: Visual Progress

Visualizing Progress is important, and by declaring a tag in your note file, you can easily see which topics you have completed hands-on for, and which ones you still need to do. This will help you stay organized and motivated to continue learning.
