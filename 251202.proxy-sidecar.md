# Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend to use Kind for quick kubernetes set up. It is easy!
> Check here: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/

This guides assume you have kubernetes cluster ready, and get the following sample response from kubectl command:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
kind-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   10d   v1.34.0
```

# Dive in

## Create kubernetes cluster

```sh
kubectl apply -f /251202
```

## Set up proxy for easier test

```sh
kubectl port-forward -n 251202-ns deployment/envoy-sidecar-demo 10000:10000
# *   Trying [::1]:10000...
# * Connected to localhost (::1) port 10000
