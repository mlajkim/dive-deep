# How I did it

## Know where I am

As of Jan 11, 2026, I want to make sure that I know where I am in terms of my general golf skills, and want to improve my driver while maintaining other performances like putter, iron, and wedge which are decent enough (Already 80s score level)

| 45y | Half swing 60" | with 75% consistency |


## I need to benchmark well

I realized that I need to benchmark as much as possible to really know where I am at, and also want to make sure my records really present:

- my improvement
- my club fitness

### How I benchmark: Non-Driver

This is my current routine that I take before getting into core routines so that I maintian these skills and my bodies are warmed up:

1. (5 minutes) Stretch
1. 5 random chipshots (60", 56", 52", P) Usually
1. Benchmark: 60" half shot and see consistency (5 shots)
1. Benchmark: 56" half shot and see consistency (5 shots)
1. Benchmark: 52" half shot and see consistency (5 shots)
1. Benchmark: P half shot and see consistency (5 shots)
1. Benchmark: 9, 8, 7, 6 Full Swing with consistency (5 shots each = 20 shots)
1. Benchmark: 9, 8, 7, 6 Full Swing but small stance with consistency (5 shots each = 20 shots)
1. Begins the Driver Benchmark (Plays only Driver Only)



### How I benchmark: Driver

## Options I can think of 

I am using the drvier with:
- Qi LS
- Tour AD VF 6

So I can think as:

1. Buy new Qi4D Driver with Max?
1. Buy less stronger shaft?

But wait, I already have a shorter shaft for my Wood5. Can I use Wood 5?
