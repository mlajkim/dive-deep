Qi LS 18g sliding weight


How to calculate swing weight:

- Grip 5g => Swing Weight 1 point Down
- Head 2g => Swing Weight 1 point Up

112g - 50g = 62g

62g / 5 = 12.2 points off

12.2 points * 2g  = 24.4g in head to balance


with heavier readings (like D0, D2) indicating more weight towards the head and lighter ones (like C8) making the club feel easier to swing
